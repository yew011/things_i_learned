Ben's way of hacking/analyzing core dump when could not logon to
user setup.


1. run "objdump -x" on the core file and look for sections that
   "look like" heaps.  (look at the 'program header' section)

2. use "hd" to check that they really look like heaps.

3. then run the "dump-heap" script on the heap segments.

Ben:
It's all very jury-rigged and unsystematic, but it often produces helpful
results.  With some work, it could be made much more precise.

Way to use:

./dump-heap core.31202 0x000000000019906c 0x000000011c066ff0 0x000000000098e010

The numbers in parentheses in the output are offsets of randomly selected
examples of blocks of those sizes, so you can run the script multiple times
and dump examples to examine.

e.g. "hd core.31202 -n <blocksize> -s <offset>"
