Options to expedite Debian ovs build.

First, turn on parallel building and turn off checking:
DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS='parallel=8 nocheck'

Second, once done an initial build, just go into the _debian directory
and run "make" normally, then "scp" the binary to the target machine.

That saves a bunch of time on subsequent builds, versus doing a full build
and then copying the deb and installing it.
