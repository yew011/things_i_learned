How to override free for stats counting

Instead of using hooks, we can do the following trick...

1. define the following macro in the header file... (ideally, the header file
   should be included by all .c files that call free)

          #define free(x) rpl_free(x)

2. implement rpl_free(x)

             void
             rpl_free(void *ptr)
             {
                /* Anything you want to run before free. */
                #undef free
                free(ptr);
                #define free(x) rpl_free(x)
             }

   Note, another trick is to (free)(ptr);

3. change all calls of 'free' via call-back pointer to 'rpl_free'
